# HealthX Pharmacy App

Personal project by Louis Caubet - 2018.

## Concept

Through this app, I wanted to offer the possibility to clients to find out if a given medicine was available at a pharmacy, reserve or order it and follow their orders directly from their smartphones.

## Technologies

The app is made with the Xamarin Forms framework, it uses Braintree to process payments. The backend is made with ASP.NET Core and an MSSQL database.
